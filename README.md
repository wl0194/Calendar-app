# Calendar-app

This week's assignment invites us to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

<!-- if you store an array of things will be alot easier -->
<!-- //look at activity 25, to get the date & time -->
<!-- //activity 11,12, to understand how to format the page -->
<!-- //week 4 activity 21 - local storage. -->
